Columbus, Ohio is booming! And, it was mentioned not only in the 2023 State of the Union address but also in the 2022 address. Has this happened before, and how often? When is it more likely to occur that a city is mentioned two years in a row? Being a central Ohio guy and excited about the future, I wanted to answer these questions. So with a little friendly wager about how long it would take Ty Henkaline stepped up to the challenge!

This project has two components:

1. A NodeJS scraper for State of the Union (SOTU) Addresses uses Puppeteer, creates a JSON array of objects that have the SOTU and a bit more from [The American Presidency Project at UCSB](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-documents-archive-guidebook/annual-messages-congress-the-state-the-union) (see [transcripts json](state_of_union_results.json))
2. R script that determines the SOTU addresses that contained cities.
